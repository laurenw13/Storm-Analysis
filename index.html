                    <h1>What Influences the Length of Atlantic Storms?</h1>
                    <p>
                        The hurricanes and tropical storms of the Atlantic have varying lengths 
                        and occur at different times of the year. We wanted to find which factors 
                        from our data set impact the length of an Atlantic storm.

                        <br><br>

                        Exploration of our data set led us to find that the maximum wind speed
                        of the storm, the diameter of the storm, and the month in which the storm
                        occurred all have some influence over the length of Atlantic storms. 
                        The following visulizations will help to show their influence.

                        This visulization shows the relationship between the wind speed and the 
                        length of the storms. (more info will be added later)
